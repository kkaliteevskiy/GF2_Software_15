"""Parse the definition file and build the logic network.

Used in the Logic Simulator project to analyse the syntactic and semantic
correctness of the symbols received from the scanner and then builds the
logic network.

Parser - parses the definition file and builds the logic network.

class Parser:

    """Parse the definition file and build the logic network.

    The parser deals with error handling. It analyses the syntactic and
    semantic correctness of the symbols it receives from the scanner, and
    then builds the logic network. If there are errors in the definition file,
    the parser detects this and tries to recover from it, giving helpful
    error messages.

    Parameters
    ----------
    names: instance of the names.Names() class.
    devices: instance of the devices.Devices() class.
    network: instance of the network.Network() class.
    monitors: instance of the monitors.Monitors() class.
    scanner: instance of the scanner.Scanner() class.
