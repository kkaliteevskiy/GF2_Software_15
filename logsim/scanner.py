"""Read the circuit definition file and translate the characters into symbols.

Used in the Logic Simulator project to read the characters in the definition
file and translate them into symbols that are usable by the parser.

Classes
-------
Scanner - reads definition file and translates characters into symbols.
Symbol - encapsulates a symbol and stores its properties.

    """Read circuit definition file and translate the characters into symbols.

    Once supplied with the path to a valid definition file, the scanner
    translates the sequence of characters in the definition file into symbols
    that the parser can use. It also skips over comments and irrelevant
    formatting characters, such as spaces and line breaks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path: path to the circuit definition file.
    names: instance of the names.Names() class.

    Public methods

                      and returns the symbol.
